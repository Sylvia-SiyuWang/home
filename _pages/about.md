I am Siyu Wang, a second-year Ph.D. candidate enrolled in the School of Computer Science at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), Australia, under the esteemed guidance of Dr. Lina Yao as my primary supervisor. My research endeavors are concentrated within the domains of machine learning, recommender systems, and causal inference.
